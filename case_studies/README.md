DTMC case studies from [Oakley et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02125.pdf). Each case study is represented as a transition probability matrix (csv file). In some cases there are also PRISM model files (pm files) associated with the case studies. To add a case study, either include the transition probability matrix as a csv file, or convert the PRISM model (pm) file to a transition probability matrix using the `convert.py` tool.
